## Summary {#summary}

I’m a Unity/C# developer focused on clean, reliable gameplay code. I work across interaction, UI, lighting and baking, audio, performance, and release workflows for PC, mobile, and VR/AR. I’m good at turning fuzzy requirements into clear tasks or building features to a specification, and I write concise docs and small utilities that prevent integration mistakes. I collaborate with artists and PMs to keep feel and polish on track.

## Proof Points {#proof-points}

- **72 FPS** targets met on Quest 2/3 & PICO (URP), with comfort/features intact  
- **≥99% crash-free sessions** tracked via Unity Cloud Diagnostics  
- **Release ops:** Meta/PICO/Android/iOS store submissions + hotfix **TTR 48–72 h**; Addressables + scripting-defines tooling → **~40% faster** build prep

## Core Strengths {#core-strengths}

- **Gameplay & tools:** clean C#, robust systems, pragmatic editor utilities that cut integration errors  
- **Performance:** budgets, profiling (Unity Profiler), scene/asset discipline (baked lighting, LODs, Addressables), platform-specific tweaks  
- **Production & quality:** requirements-to-spec, Definition of Done gates, telemetry/crash triage, cross-platform release workflows (Quest ↔ PICO)

## Tech Snapshot {#tech-snapshot}

**Engine:** Unity 2019 → Unity 6 LTS  
**Rendering:** URP (HDRP for PC work)  
**Gameplay/AI:** NavMesh, ScriptableObjects, state-machine style AI/perception, Behavior Trees (WIP)  
**UI/Input:** New Input System, uGUI, settings menus  
**Cameras/Flow:** Cinemachine, Timeline  
**Assets & Loading:** Addressables, scene/asset discipline (baked lighting, LODs)  
**Perf & Diagnostics:** Unity Profiler, Unity Analytics, Cloud Diagnostics  
**XR:** XR Interaction Toolkit, OpenXR (Quest/PICO)  
**Versioning/PM:** PlasticSCM (Unity Version Control), Linear, Notion  
**Platforms:** PC, Quest/PICO, Android/iOS  

## Personal {#personal}

When I’m not in Unity I’m usually on a hill in Gwynedd, often Yr Eifl, chasing good light for photos. I keep a tiny home gym by the desk so training actually happens: bike sessions on a HIIT / tempo / threshold rotation and a day of resistance work. I log ideas for my Steam PC title and small prototypes; most get binned. I like horror, survival, and story-driven games that reward planning, and I make room for all of it around family time.
