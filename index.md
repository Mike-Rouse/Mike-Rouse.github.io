## Featured Work {#featured}

### Aberwla — Welsh-language VR Minigames · Quest/PICO · 2025

*A Welsh-language VR release for Meta Quest and PICO: an explorable town with minigames that immerse players in spoken Welsh and meet platform performance and stability budgets.*
*Originally commissioned by **Gwynedd Council** for Welsh Immersion Centres; later funded by **Adnodd** for public release.*

**Team & Collaboration** — Lead dev; managed 1 Unity dev; coordinated 2 3D artists; partnered with the Creative Director on minigame scope & direction.

<!-- TODO: Change video to 8–12s silent loop (self-hosted <video>), plus a “Watch full trailer →” link to YouTube. -->
{% include video id="pEuDcjNigXc" provider="youtube" caption="Aberwla gameplay trailer." %}

### What I Owned

- **Core gameplay & minigames** — designed → greybox → production; multiplayer (Normcore); AI (FSM); baked lighting; spatial audio; UX/UI; profiled/optimised to device budgets.
- **Quest↔PICO build-switch tooling** — Addressables + scripting defines → **~40% faster** build prep; **0** hand-switch regressions across 6 releases.
- **Release operations end-to-end** — ratings, store assets/copy, privacy, submissions → hotfix TTR **48–72 h**.

### Results

- **72 FPS** on Quest 2/3 & PICO (targets met)
- **≥99% crash-free** sessions (Unity Cloud Diagnostics)
- **Team:** 4
